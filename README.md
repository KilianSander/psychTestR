# psychTestR

psychTestR is an R package for creating behavioural experiment interfaces.
Key benefits of psychTestR include:

- Easy installation
- Supports testing on your local computer (laboratory conditions) or on a web server (online recruitment)
- Fully within the R ecosystem, no knowledge of other programming languages required
- Powerful back-end processing that allows you to use all the flexibility of R during test administration
- Scales well to hundreds of concurrent users
- Compatible with all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Easy to modularise and share your designs with other researchers
