- replace all occurrences of rv with state
- introduce S3 object for state
- introduce save_data - a function for saving data within the state object
- add save_key argument to relevant functions, it can be NULL (don't save result)
or alternatively any R object that will then be used as key in the data storage
- add data saving to psych_server
- refactor psych_server
- add data upload options to psych_server
- accumulate a list of results as the test continues
- first level of the list is test sections (you can start a new section with begin_section())
- second level is test items, usually each corresponding to one particular test page
- each test item has a key and a value, which can be arbitrary R objects
- rename functions
- automatically write session.js to the project/www directory
