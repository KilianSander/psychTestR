- accumulate a list of results as the test continues
- first level of the list is test sections (you can start a new section with begin_section())
- second level is test items, usually each corresponding to one particular test page
- each test item has a key and a value, which can be arbitrary R objects
- rename functions
- automatically write session.js to the project/www directory
