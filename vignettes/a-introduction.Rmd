## About

psychTestR is an R package for developing and administering 
behavioural experiments. This vignette provides a first introduction 
to psychTestR; by the end, you should feel ready to create a simple
psychTestR test of your own.
This introduction assumes that the reader is already moderately familiar
with the programming language R.

## Architecture

psychTestR builds on the web application framework [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).
Shiny is a powerful open-source framework that is supported by 
[RStudio, Inc.](http://www.rstudio.com).
The Shiny framework was designed to allow users to construct interactive 
dashboards in R that could easily be deployed to remote servers.
psychTestR specialises Shiny to the application of psychological experiment design,
providing a straightforward way to design linear sequences of test pages
that elicit and record responses from the participant.

Like Shiny, psychTestR uses the 
[htmltools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmltools/index.html)
package to programmatically generate HTML code from R code.
This package allows the user to design complex HTML interfaces by composing 
R functions.
htmltools functions can be used directly within psychTestR to construct
highly customisable test interfaces.

Like all Shiny apps, psychTestR tests are hosted on a server running R code.
These tests can be hosted locally from one's own computer,
which is useful both for test development and for conducting 
in-person data collection.
Tests can also be deployed to remote servers for online data collection
without changing any of the underlying R code -- see 
[Hosting experiments online](https://pmcharrison.github.io/psychTestR/articles/2-hosting-experiments-online.html)
for details.

## Pages

The most essential unit of a psychTestR test is the *page*.
Pages display content to the user and optionally collect responses.
The most flexible way of creating psychTestR pages is with the `page`
function.
However, psychTestR provides many helper functions for creating particular
types of pages, which can often be useful for saving legwork
and increasing readability.
For example, the function `one_button_page` defines a page 
that displays a prompt to the user and provides a single button
with which the user may advance to the next page.
The below code defines a page that displays "Welcome to the test!"
and a "Next" button:

```r
library(psychTestR)
one_button_page("Welcome to the test!")
```

If you run this code in RStudio,
it should display the test element in your Viewer window:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/introduction/welcome.png")
```

Here the prompt took the form of raw text, without any HTML specifications.
We can use the `htmltools` package to create such specifications, for example:

``` r
library(psychTestR)
library(htmltools)

one_button_page(
div(
p("An example of ", tags$strong("bold"), "text;"),
p("An example of ", tags$em("italic"), "text.")
)
)
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/introduction/htmltools.png")
```

This page doesn't collect any information from the participant.
An example of a page that does collect information is the 
*N-alternative forced choice* page, as created by the `NAFC_page` function.
This function allows the user to specify several choices to the user
which will be displayed as clickable buttons.
The participant must click one of these buttons to advance to the next page,
and their choice will be automatically recorded.

```r
library(psychTestR)
NAFC_page("favourite_colour",
"What is your favourite colour?",
c("Red", "Green", "Blue"))
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/introduction/favourite-colour.png")
```

psychTestR contains various built-in page types like these, for example:

- `text_input_page`
- `audio_NAFC_page`
- `video_NAFC_page`
- `dropdown_NAFC_page`
- `final_page`

Tests should generally conclude with a *final page*, as produced
by `final_page`: these final pages have no buttons to advance
to the next page, and so provide a good way to end the test.

You can also define custom page types using the general-purpose `page` function.
In our experience, it's useful to use the source code of pre-existing page types
as templates for defining custom page types.
If you think that your page type might be useful to other psychTestR users,
you may consider wrapping it as a function and 
submitting it as a pull request to the 
[psychTestR repository](https://github.com/pmcharrison/psychTestR),
so that it can be incorporated into the psychTestR codebase.

## Timelines

A psychTestR test comprises a sequence of test elements,
termed a *timeline*.
There are three main types of test elements:

- Pages;
- Reactive pages;
- Code blocks.

We will get to reactive pages and code blocks in due course.
First, we'll construct a timeline comprising solely pages.
A timeline may be constructed using the `list` function from base R:

```r
library(psychTestR)
timeline <- list(
one_button_page("Page 1"),
one_button_page("Page 2"),
final_page("The end")
)
```

Note that we concluded the timeline with the `final_page` function.
A *final page* is like a *one-button page*, but without a 
button to advance to the next page. 

```r
final_page("The end")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/introduction/final-page.png")
```

We can run the resulting test as follows:

```r
library(psychTestR)
timeline <- list(
one_button_page("Page 1"),
one_button_page("Page 2"),
final_page("The end")
)
test <- make_test(elts = timeline)
shiny::runApp(test)
```

The resulting test should display in your RStudio Viewer window, 
or in your web browser, depending on your RStudio configuration.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/introduction/simple-test.png")
```

This test doesn't collect any data. 
Let's define another test that does collect data:

```r
library(psychTestR)
timeline <- list(
NAFC_page("favourite_colour",
"What is your favourite colour?",
c("Red", "Green", "Blue")),
elt_save_results_to_disk(complete = TRUE),
final_page("Thanks for completing the survey!")
)
test <- make_test(elts = timeline)
shiny::runApp(test)
```

Note that we have introduced a new builder function,
`elt_save_results_to_disk`. This function doesn't resolve to a 
psychTestR page, but instead resolves to a so-called code block:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
elt_save_results_to_disk(complete = TRUE)
```

Code blocks don't display anything to the user, but instead instruct
the server to run a specified function.
This function can take several inputs, but most important is the `state`
object, which stores information relevant to that particular participant's
testing session, such as their responses to N-alternative forced choice
pages.
This particular function takes the `state` object as input and 
saves the participant's results to disk, paying attention to certain
test configuration options as specified in `opt`.

Having run this test, we should see that it generates an RDS file 
in the directory `output/results`. The name of this RDS file will contain the 
participant's ID, which by default is randomly generated.
RDS files provided compressed versions of R objects.
We can read our RDS file into R using the `readRDS` function.
The code below lists all files in the results directory with the 
extension `.rds`, and reads the first one into R:

```r
rds_files <- list.files("output/results", 
pattern = "\\.rds$", 
full.names = TRUE)
res <- readRDS(rds_files[1])
res
```

```{r}
res <- readRDS("sample-results/ex-1.rds")
res
```

We can visualise this results file with the `as.list` function:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
as.list(res)
```

We see that my favourite colour is green. 
We can also coerce the results file to a tabular format using the
`as_tibble` or `as.data.frame` functions:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
as_tibble(res)
```

## Build time versus test time 

At this point it's worth explaining the difference between *build time*
and *test time*. Build time corresponds to the moment when you create
a list of test elements and pass them to `make_test`.
psychTestR takes all of your builder functions, such as `NAFC_page` and 
`one_button_page`, and evaluates them to produe a series of test elements,
where an individual test element looks like this under the hood:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
as.list(NAFC_page("favourite_colour",
                  "What is your favourite colour?",
                  c("Red", "Green", "Blue")))
```

psychTestR can then refer to these resolved test elements when 
administering them to participants, instead of running the builder functions
(e.g. `NAFC_page`) from scratch each time.

While build time happens before any participants take the test,
test time refers to the participant's testing session itself.
Test time code is useful for things like saving the participant's results,
defining test elements that depend on the participant's actions,
and randomising stimulus administration.

Readers who have written Shiny apps may have written server files 
that look something like this:

``` r
library(shiny)

# Run once on app launch
data <- read.csv("data.csv")[, 2]

# Run separately for each user
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
bins <- seq(min(data), max(data), length.out = input$bins + 1)
hist(data, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
})
```

In this example, the function within `shinyServer` is called separately
for each app user, creating an isolated workspace that stores
variables specific to that user's session.
This corresponds to our 'run-time code' in psychTestR.

However, the code example also contains a call to `read.csv` prior 
to the `shinyServer` function, in order to the `data` object.
This call only happens once, on app launch, and creates an 
R object that is shared by all users sessions.
This corresponds to our 'build-time code' in psychTestR.

This distinction between build-time code and run-time code is 
part of what makes Shiny and hence psychTestR able to efficiently scale
to many concurrent users. Objects that are the same for all participants
may be defined in build-time code, and this object need only be stored 
once in memory. Objects that are specific to individual participants
are then stored in run-time code.

Most psychTestR users never have to interact with the `shinyServer` function
directly. Instead, run-time code is defined as part of the three main
types of test elements: code blocks, simple pages, and reactive pages.
This run-time code depends heavily on the notion of *session state*,
which will now be introduced.

## Session states

Each participant has a so-called 'session state', which characterises
their current position in the test as well any results or other variables
that have accumulated along the way.
By default, session states are saved to disk in the directory `output/sessions`.^[
If you are interested, you can inspect these session states in R 
using the `readRDS` function. Note however that these objects
are not documented and their structure is subject to change
with future versions of psychTestR.
]
Session states are identifed by the corresponding participant IDs;
each participant ID may be associated with no more than one session state.

The primary role of session states in test development is for 
storing and accessing variables that are specific 
to the particular participant's testing session.
For example, we might define a counter corresponding
to the number of correct responses so far.
These variables are termed *session variables*.

There are two types of session variables: 
*global variables* and *local variables*.
Each variable is identifed by a *key* that simply corresponds to a character
string, such as `"counter"` or `"start_time"`. 
Values may be assigned to these variables using the function
`set_global` (for global variables)
or the function `set_local` (for local variables).
Values may be retrieved from these variables using the functions
`get_global` and `get_local`.

Global variables and local variables differ in their *scope*.
Global variables persist for an entire testing session,
and are accessible to all run-time code.
No more than one global variable can be defined for a given key.
Local variables, meanwhile, only persist for the duration of a module.
A module is a self-contained unit of psychTestR test elements
that uses an isolated set of local variables;
modules can be created using the functions `begin_module` and `end_module`.
Local variables are deleted upon termination of a module.
It is also possible to nest modules;
each nested module will have its own set of local variables,
potentially with variable keys being duplicated across modules.
Run-time code will only have access to the lowest-level module
at that point in the test's timeline.

Manipulating session variables requires run-time code.
As mentioned previously, run-time code can be created for each
of the three main types of test elements:
code blocks, simple pages, and reactive pages.
We will now consider each approach in turn.

## Code blocks

A code block is a test element that solely comprises run-time code
and does not contain a user interface component.
Code blocks may be created with the `code_block` function.
The primary argument to `code_block` is `fun`,
an R function that will be called at run time.
This R function will typically take two arguments:
`state` and `...`.
The `state` argument represents the session state,
whereas the `...` argument captures further optional arguments
that will not be covered here.

Within the code block function, we can access and set session variables
using the four functions introduced above:
`set_global`, `set_local`, `get_global`, and `get_local`.
These functions each require the `state` object to be provided as an input.

Here is an example of a code block that stores the time
when the run-time code was executed:

```r
library(psychTestR)
code_block(function(state, ...) {
set_global(key = "time_started", 
value = Sys.time(), 
state = state)
})
```

We could then refer to this variable later in the test 
to compute the total time taken, 
as in the following example:

```{r}
library(psychTestR)

save_time_started <- code_block(function(state, ...) {
  set_global(key = "time_started", 
             value = Sys.time(), 
             state = state)
})

compute_time_taken <- code_block(function(state, ...) {
  time_taken <- Sys.time() - get_global("time_started", state)
  msg <- paste0("Time taken: ", format(time_taken, digits = 3))
  shiny::showNotification(msg)
})

make_test(
  list(
    save_time_started,
    one_button_page("Continue when you're ready."),
    compute_time_taken,
    final_page("End")
  ))
```

## Reactive pages

Reactive pages are pages that are created by run-time code.
This is useful when you wish to present the user with randomised stimuli
or other information that is only available at run time.

Reactive pages are defined using the `reactive_page` function.
Like code blocks, the primary argument to this function is the
argument `fun`, taking the form of an R function that must 
accept the argument `...`.
At run-time, this function will be called with several input arguments,
including most importantly:

- `state`, corresponding to the participant's session state object;
- `answer`, corresponding to the participant's most recent response.

The reactive page function must return a test page,
which will be displayed to the participant at the appropriate point in the test.

The psychTestR specification requires reactive page functions to be 
*idempotent*, meaning that calling it multiple times should have 
the same effect as calling the function once.
Reactive pages are therefore not the right place to write code
that has side effects, like incrementing counters or saving results.

Here is an example test with a reactive page that displays the current time:

```r
library(psychTestR)

make_test(list(
  reactive_page(function(...) {
    msg <- format(Sys.time(), "The current time is %H:%M:%S.")
    final_page(msg)
  })
))
```

Note that the time updates if you refresh the page.

Here is a second example demonstrating the use of the `answer` argument:

```r
library(psychTestR)

make_test(list(
  NAFC_page("q1", "What is your favourite colour?",
            c("Red", "Green", "Blue")),
  reactive_page(function(answer, ...) {
    msg <- sprintf("Your favourite colour is %s.", answer)
    final_page(msg)
  })
))
```

## Simple pages and run-time code

Often it is useful to associate run-time code with a simple page.
The documentation for simple pages (`?page`) outlines 
various ways of achieving this through different function arguments.
In particular, the following arguments involve run-time code:

### `get_answer`

This is an optional function for extracting the 
participant's answer from the current page. This function should
accept an argument termed `input`, which provides access to 
any input elements that have been defined as part of the page UI.
For example, the UI for `text_input_page` includes a text-box input
defined as follows:

``` r 
shiny::textInput("text_input", 
label = NULL,
placeholder = placeholder,
width = width)
```

The first argument to `shiny::textInput` determines the input slot
that will be used to access the value in the text box.
Correspondingly, the `get_answer` argument is defined simply as follows:

``` r
get_answer = function(input, ...) input$text_input
```

It is possible to define more complex `get_answer` functions that 
perform arbitrary post-processing on the user input, for example
by converting text strings to numbers, deleting whitespace, and so on.

### `validate`

`validate` is an optional function that checks whether the participant
has returned a satisfactory response for the current page.
It should return `TRUE` for a successful validation;
for an unsuccessful validation, it should return either `FALSE`
or an error message, expressed as a character string. 
If validation fails then the page will be refreshed, 
usually to give the user a chance to revise their input.
The following code provides a simple example:

```{r}
library(psychTestR)

make_test(
list(
text_input_page("example", "What is 1 + 1?", validate = function(answer, ...) {
res <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(answer))
if (!is.na(res) && res == 2) TRUE else "Try again!"
}),
final_page("End."))
)
)
```

### `on_complete`

`on_complete` is an optional function that is run once the page is completed
and all validation checks have passed successfully.
The below example shows a pop-up notification with the current time.

```{r}
library(psychTestR)

make_test(
  list(
    one_button_page("Hello!", on_complete = function(...) {
      shiny::showNotification(paste0("The current time is ", Sys.time(), "."))
    }),
    final_page("End.")
  )
)
```
